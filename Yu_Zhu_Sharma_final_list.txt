We chose the E value threshold of 0.1 based on our research on E value for protein. E value less than 0.1 is considered significant. 

Here are the most ideal proteins which have both mcrA genes and hsp70 genes, ranked by the number of mcrA gene first, and then hsp70 genes

This proteome has 1 mcrA gene, so it could make methane, however, there is no hsp gene found, therefore, it has low pH resistance.

proteome_29

Here is a list of proteomes which has no mcrA gene, but has one or more hsp70 genes, ranked by the pH resistance.

These 3 proteomes are not ideal because they have neither mcrA gene or hsp70 gene.
